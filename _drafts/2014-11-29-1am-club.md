### tldr
tilde club style static hosting on amazon ec2

### What is 1am.club

It's a Debian box on amazon ec2 you can request a user on. You can host static websites from /public_html/ with a few nicities like es6 transpilation, peer js signalling server, node (configured to for -g to install your local user), sass etc.

It's very much a learning project on my half. I am not professional sysop and am bound to make mistakes. There is no guarantee of data security or regular back ups.

It's entirely https to allow experimentation with new web technologies which is nice. :)

### The proxy implentation

The proxy which handles the redirection and static hosting is built on top of [`http-proxy`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy) with the goal of allowing easy configuration. It handles internal proxy redirects to map urls to different endpoints on one server. It also does redirection and static hosting. It's used in thsi situation to redirected all http requests to https and to provide and endpoint for the es6 transpiling service.
