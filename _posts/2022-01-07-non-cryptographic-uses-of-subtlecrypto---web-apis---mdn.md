title: "Non-cryptographic uses of SubtleCrypto - Web APIs | MDN"
description: "This article does not discuss the cryptographic uses of the SubtleCrypto interface. An important thing to take away from this article is don't use this API for production cryptographic purposes because it is powerful and low level. To use it correctly you will need to take many context specific steps to accomplish cryptographic tasks correctly. If any of those steps are taken incorrectly at best your code won't run, at worse it will run and you will unknowingly be putting your users at risk with an insecure product."
